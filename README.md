# JavaChallenge_Somya

Great job Sowmya in completing the challenges !! I hope it was a good learning exercise. Please find my comments below:

1. I like it that all your classes are in a package. Good job
    1. Class names should have Pascal and methods to have camel case, no underscores in class or method names.
2. Method name should always have a verb - Ex in ASCII.java - there is a method ASCIIValue whcih is a not. It should be either convertToAsciiValue or any other you think is appropriate
3. Variables should not be c etc …please give a meaningful name
4. Good job on the comments explaining what your program is doing.
5. Please avoid using short forms like avg etc …it is a good practice not to use short forms because we take it for granted. There may be people who would not understand what ele or avg stands for.
6. Class names cannot be verbs - Ex - ConcatenateStrings could be StringConcatenation
7. Please avoid clashes with java keywords in your classes - Ex - DateTime - could have been something more specific to the use case
8. Perfect square logic can be done with a different logic to make the code more simple, please try the same.
9. Permutations - please make sure input is not hardcoded. A program should be able to work for any input ..hardcoding a value defeats the purpose
10.  ReplaceChar - please take the char to be replaced also as input
11. Typo in Volume of cylinder - Enter radius and height not radius and radius
